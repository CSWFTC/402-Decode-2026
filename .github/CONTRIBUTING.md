Do not push code to the main branch.

All changes should be pushed to specific feature branches, and then have a pull request submitted for them.
All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by a senior member of the team (Arnav or Josh)

Keep branches specific to only one feature, and remember to push and pull often from the main branch.

Never push code (even to specific branches) that does not build/compile
