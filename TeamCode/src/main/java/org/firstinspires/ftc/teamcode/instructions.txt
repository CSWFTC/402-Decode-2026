Go to settings in the top right and search "SDK"

Copy the path of your local SDK

In your terminal, type cd and then paste in your path: cd path

Then, cd platform-tools

Then, ./adb connect 192.168.43.1

If it says connected, you can run the code using the play button at the top of Android Studio

If it doesn't work, type the following commands in order
./adb disconnect
./adb kill-server
./adb start-server
./adb connect 192.168.43.1

If it still doesn't work, try turning off the robot and turning it back on
